So, why am I doing
a blog as well? Can he really be that vain? Does the internet need more clutter? Short answer,
no. No, it doesn't.<p class="blog-post__content"></p>I'm interested in the idea of learning publicly. I've always been one to hide away and
study some topic, waiver on the fence about a question until I was certain of its answer. 
I'm not sure this approach has always been to my benefit. To be honest, I think there's a great
deal of value to be wrought from learning in front of people, in trying to figure things out
as you go, of being wrong and having somebody tell you why.<p class="blog-post__content"></p>So, here I am, dedicating myself *publicly* to this aim! I will use this platform to learn,
to explain my thoughts, to ask my questions. By volume, this blog will likely be tutorial-type
posts about something I struggled with. Due to my digital signal processing course, I'll have 
ample inspiration.<p class="blog-post__content"></p>I'm also excited by this because I've written the whole thing from scratch, which has been a
blast so far. I'm thrilled to flesh out a blogging platform and will likely write a post or two
about the things I learned and how I learned them. One of the big things I'm excited for is 
the integration with MathJax, a LaTeX rendering engine for the web! Check this out:
\[ \delta (n - m) \Leftrightarrow z^{ - m} ,\left| z \right| > 1 \]
For the interested reader, the above equation represents the Z-transform of a time-shifted
\(\delta\) function. And it's built right in! That's not a picture! I'm pumped!<p class="blog-post__content"></p>Anyway, thanks for reading so far. I'm excited to see where this goes!</section></main></body><footer class="footer"><p class="footer__text">&copy; 2019 by Pat Conrey</p></footer></html>
