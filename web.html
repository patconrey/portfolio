                    I didn't really expect to work too much in web. I was barely competent with HTML and CSS when I was thrown
                    into a PHP project. I learned a lot. Since then, I fell in love with frontend web work. I learned SCSS
                    through a udemy course and now it's my preferred domain.

                    Below is a project I want to highlight. It aws a blast to build and collaborate on, please let

                            I loved being a part of the University of Kentucky's Student Government Association (SGA). It taught
                            me a lot that I hadn't been exposed to in my engineering curriculum. However, our site was terrible.
                            It was a wordpress site that suffered years of mismanagement and neglect. By the time I took over as 
                            Directory of Technology, the site was unusably slow and usually hacked. When SGA's advisor got an email
                            from the dean of a college at a different university saying that our site was redirecting people to 
                            explicit content, I knew it was time for a groundup rebuild.

                                students to get in touch. We decided it would be best to have an email entry.
                                We've collected lots of emails! We noticed some spam, so we honeypotted the 
                                field and fixed the problem.

                                    SGA gives a lot of money to student orgs. We have legislation that
                                    orchestrates the process. We wanted to help students understand the
                                    ways to get funding and the types of funding we have to help them
                                    get the best for their organization!

                            I wanted to address the root cause of the underlying problem: the people previously responsible for the
                            site weighed it down with plugins and widgets. Collaborating with the executive team, we decided that the 
                            new site would have minimal features. No calendars, no image carousels, no blogs. We identified a number of
                            use cases and derived our features from there.
                            <br><br>
                            Students rely on SGA for a lot of resources, some they don't even realize we have!
                            I think the most common resource is funding. SGA gives a lot of money to on campus orgs
                            and the process can be pretty confusing. We wanted to clearly lay out the process and types
                            of funding we have.

                            Since our legislation outlines the ways to be elected and run a campaign
                            as well as how to receive funding from SGA, we needed to make all of
                            those resources easily accessible. We built the Legislation page and a
                            way admins can upload new versions of legislation from a custom CMS.
                            <br><br>
                            Students generally didn't know all of the services we provide, many
                            of which are super useful. We wanted a way to showcase them
                            and provide ways for students to get in touch with the people 
                            that run them.

                                Our legislation affects how students can get funding, participate
                                in elections, and behave as a member of SGA. On our previous site,
                                our legislation was constantly out of date and hard to find. We fixed
                                this! Admins can update the legislation versions from our custom CMS, 
                                keeping every student up to date.

                                There are lots of people in SGA. We wanted to make sure that 
                                anybody would be able to see who's representing them easily and
                                quickly. The profiles are managed through the CMS and can be readily
                                edited or deleted.

                            come up that affect students, they want to be able to get in 
                            contact with the people that can fix the issues. We created 
                            profiles complete with headshots, position titles, and
                            contact information for everybody in SGA.
                            You can find these under the Branches tab.

                            We wanted students to feel like they were able to join our 
                            organization, so we needed a way to collect emails from 
                            curious visitors. We put the email form directly on the home
                            page so it was impossible to miss.

                            The site took the  majority of a semester to build. We used 
                            Symfony and created a CMS, accessible for non-technical admins,
                            that could easily manage all of the content on the site.
                            <br><br>
                            The feedback was immediate and kind. We collected dozens of emails and got more people involved than we had 
                            before. Students use the site to get information on our services. People have downloaded meeting minutes and 
                            legislation. Administrators were thrilled. It was a big win. Currently the site is maintained by Hayden Free,
