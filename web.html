I was barely competent with HTML and CSS when I was thrown
into a PHP project. I learned a lot. Since then, I fell in love with frontend web work. I learned SCSS
through a udemy course and now it's my preferred domain.<br/><br/>Below is a project I want to highlight. It aws a blast to build and collaborate on, please let
me know if you have questions!</p></div></header><main><section class="section section-no-flex" id="SGA"><div class="subsection"><div class="subsection__left-50"><h1 class="heading-primary">SGA</h1><p class="description">I loved being a part of the University of Kentucky's Student Government Association (SGA). It taught
me a lot that I hadn't been exposed to in my engineering curriculum. However, our site was terrible.
It was a wordpress site that suffered years of mismanagement and neglect. By the time I took over as 
Directory of Technology, the site was unusably slow and usually hacked. When SGA's advisor got an email
from the dean of a college at a different university saying that our site was redirecting people to 
explicit content, I knew it was time for a groundup rebuild.</p></div><div class="subsection__right"><figure class="web-img"><img class="web-img__image lazy-image" src="img/home_preview_blur.png" data-src="img/home_preview_scaled.png" alt="SGA landing page screenshot"/><figcaption class="figure__caption web-img__caption">The landing view for the SGA homepage. We wanted an easy way for curious
students to get in touch. We decided it would be best to have an email entry.
We've collected lots of emails! We noticed some spam, so we honeypotted the 
field and fixed the problem.</figcaption></figure></div></div><div class="subsection"><div class="subsection__left"><figure class="web-img"><img class="web-img__image lazy-image" data-src="img/funding_preview_scaled.png" src="img/funding_preview_blur.png" alt="SGA funding page screenshot"/><figcaption class="figure__caption web-img__caption">SGA gives a lot of money to student orgs. We have legislation that
orchestrates the process. We wanted to help students understand the
ways to get funding and the types of funding we have to help them
get the best for their organization!</figcaption></figure></div><div class="subsection__right-50"><p class="description">I wanted to address the root cause of the underlying problem: the people previously responsible for the
site weighed it down with plugins and widgets. Collaborating with the executive team, we decided that the 
new site would have minimal features. No calendars, no image carousels, no blogs. We identified a number of
use cases and derived our features from there.<br/><br/>Students rely on SGA for a lot of resources, some they don't even realize we have!
I think the most common resource is funding. SGA gives a lot of money to on campus orgs
and the process can be pretty confusing. We wanted to clearly lay out the process and types
of funding we have.</p></div></div><div class="subsection"><div class="subsection__left-50"><p class="description">Since our legislation outlines the ways to be elected and run a campaign
as well as how to receive funding from SGA, we needed to make all of
those resources easily accessible. We built the Legislation page and a
way admins can upload new versions of legislation from a custom CMS.<br/><br/>Students generally didn't know all of the services we provide, many
of which are super useful. We wanted a way to showcase them
and provide ways for students to get in touch with the people 
that run them. </p></div><div class="subsection__right"><figure class="web-img"><img class="web-img__image lazy-image" data-src="img/legislation_preview_scaled.png" src="img/legislation_preview_blur.png" alt="SGA legislation page screenshot"/><figcaption class="figure__caption web-img__caption">Our legislation affects how students can get funding, participate
in elections, and behave as a member of SGA. On our previous site,
our legislation was constantly out of date and hard to find. We fixed
this! Admins can update the legislation versions from our custom CMS, 
keeping every student up to date.</figcaption></figure></div></div><div class="subsection"><div class="subsection__left"><figure class="web-img"><img class="web-img__image lazy-image" data-src="img/profiles_preview_scaled.png" src="img/profiles_preview_blur.png" alt="SGA executive page screenshot"/><figcaption class="figure__caption web-img__caption">There are lots of people in SGA. We wanted to make sure that 
anybody would be able to see who's representing them easily and
quickly. The profiles are managed through the CMS and can be readily
edited or deleted.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="subsection__right-50"><p class="description">Students vote for their representation every spring. When things
come up that affect students, they want to be able to get in 
contact with the people that can fix the issues. We created 
profiles complete with headshots, position titles, and
contact information for everybody in SGA.
You can find these under the Branches tab.<br/><br/>We wanted students to feel like they were able to join our 
organization, so we needed a way to collect emails from 
curious visitors. We put the email form directly on the home
page so it was impossible to miss.</p></div></div><div class="subsection"><div class="subsection__left-50"><p class="description">The site took the  majority of a semester to build. We used 
Symfony and created a CMS, accessible for non-technical admins,
that could easily manage all of the content on the site.</p><p class="description">The feedback was immediate and kind. We collected dozens of emails and got more people involved than we had 
before. Students use the site to get information on our services. People have downloaded meeting minutes and 
legislation. Administrators were thrilled. It was a big win. Currently the site is maintained by
<a href="https://github.com/haydenfree" target="_blank">Hayden Free,</a>
who is doing a fantastic job.</p></div><div class="subsection__right"><figure class="web-img"><img class="web-img__image lazy-image" data-src="img/records_preview_scaled.png" src="img/records_preview_blur.png" alt="SGA records page screenshot"/><figcaption class="figure__caption web-img__caption">SGA is required by *law* to maintain records of its meetings.
We created a way that students can easily get the most recent 
minutes for whatever committee they want!    </figcaption></figure></div></div></section></main><script src="./js/lazyLoadImages.js"></script></body><footer class="footer"><p class="footer__text">&copy; 2019 by Pat Conrey</p></footer></html>
