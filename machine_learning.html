                    iOS Development was my first entrance into consumer application programming. Since I've started,
                    I've launched my own company, worked for a startup in Lexington, KY, and am currently working as
                    an iOS contractor at Bayer Crop Sciences. It all started with my first iOS app, Scene. The image
                    here is from the night of the launch.
                    <br><br>
                    Below are the projects I want to highlight. I've worked on several more so if you want to know more,
                    please reach out!

                            This app was a lot of fun to program and design. Users can create an account with their 
                            email, password and some other information, e.g., profile picture, birthday, etc. They can 
                            search for others and start conversations, lock certain conversations with a passcode they 
                            choose, send and save images and videos, view them later in custom media players, and update 
                            their password and email.

                            It all started with a personal challenge: how fast can I develop a robust chat application? 
                            Firebase was a huge help, and OneSignal beautifully handled push notifications. The design 
                            was largely inspired by purple, my favorite color, and Google's Material standard. This was 
                            the next big project I worked on after my first app, Scene. I wanted to focus on the user. 
                            At the time, that meant pretty animations and a good color scheme. With research, I came to 
                            learn about accessibility and developing for all users regardless of their culture, capabilities, 
                            or background. I learned a ton and refine those lessons every day.

                            All of those features are built, but there's still work to do before I put it on the App Store. 
                            It seems that there's a new chat application everyday. I want to convert the underlying network 
                            calls to utilize a mesh network for localized communication. This would be useful if, for example, 
                            you're on a trip with your friends and don't want to use up data.
