                    iOS Development was my first entrance into consumer application programming. Since I've started,
                    I've launched my own company, worked for a startup in Lexington, KY, and am currently working as
                    an iOS contractor at Bayer Crop Sciences. It all started with my first iOS app, Scene. The image
                    here is from the night of the launch.
                    <br><br>
                    Below are the projects I want to highlight. I've worked on several more so if you want to know more,

                            search for others and start conversations, lock certain conversations with a passcode they 
                            choose, send and save images and videos, view them later in custom media players, and update

                            It all started with a personal challenge: how fast can I develop a robust chat application? 
                            Firebase was a huge help, and OneSignal beautifully handled push notifications. The design 
                            was largely inspired by purple, my favorite color, and Google's Material standard. This was 
                            the next big project I worked on after my first app, Scene. I wanted to focus on the user. 
                            At the time, that meant pretty animations and a good color scheme. With research, I came to 
                            learn about accessibility and developing for all users regardless of their culture, capabilities, 
                            or background. I learned a ton and refine those lessons every day.

                            All of those features are built, but there's still work to do before I put it on the App Store. 
                            It seems that there's a new chat application everyday. I want to convert the underlying network 
                            calls to utilize a mesh network for localized communication. This would be useful if, for example, 
                            you're on a trip with your friends and don't want to use up data.

                            This app takes building blocks to the AR stage. You can select different materials and 
                            build whatever structure you can imagine right in your living room. You can save structures,
                            which triggers the app to construct a custom XML file describing your structure, saving it 
                            locally and uploading it to a sever. Ultimately, I want to be able to share structures 
                            between users, create fun textures with special properties, and collaboratively build in 
                            realtime with a friend.

                            I'm curious about the role AR will play in tech over the next couple years. I'm 
                            particularly excited about its potential in the context of education. I'd love to chat 
                            about this, please drop me a line!

                        <p class="description">
                            Scene was a social app that let users in a given city log on and see what was happening around them. 
                            They could like and comment on scenes (the name we assigned to event listings). We provided 
                            authentication through email, Facebook, and anonymous users. The entire app was built on Firebase 
                            and we handled push notifications with OneSignal. Scene was my first dive into programming beyond 
                            the python and C++ encountered in the standard Electrical Engineering curriculum. I learned Swift 
                            through countless hours of Youtube videos, reading Apple's documentation, and Stack Overflow. 
                            It was an ... experience ... to say the least.

                            My friend came up with the idea in our sophomore year of college. I designed all of the 
                            interfaces over the next few months and we began scouting for a mobile developer. None of 
                            them worked out, so I decided to program it myself. Before I started learning the language, 
                            I sent screenshots of the UI to my friend in Silicon Valley -- the only developer I knew. 
                            His advice was simple: "That's ambitious. But doable, definitely doable!" Enduring innumerable 
                            crashes, failed features, bad designs, tons of revisions, and full course loads for two 
                            degrees, I launched Scene on the App Store in April 2017.
                            <br>
                            What started with a simple idea launched me on a pretty awesome journey. Through it, I learned 
                            the basics of iOS development, team management, project planning, and even talked to angel 
                            investors. Since April 2017, I've developed and designed all of the projects you see on this site.

                            Juke was a fun, small project I made for a friend: she didn't listen to music too much since she 
                            liked CDs and was rarely in her car. I got the idea for a music player interface that prominently 
                            displays a spinning CD of the album art for the current song.

                            This app isn't connected to the internet or a streaming service. It would just come with a 
                            preloaded playlist of songs. The code isn't hosted on my GitHub, but if you're interested please
