                    | I loved being a part of the University of Kentucky's Student Government Association (SGA). It taught
                    | me a lot that I hadn't been exposed to in my engineering curriculum. However, our site was terrible.
                    | It was a wordpress site that suffered years of mismanagement and neglect. By the time I took over as 
                    | Directory of Technology, the site was unusably slow and usually hacked. When SGA's advisor got an email
                    | from the dean of a college at a different university saying that our site was redirecting people to 
                    | explicit content, I knew it was time for a groundup rebuild.

                        | We've collected lots of emails! We noticed some spam, so we honeypotted the 
                        | field and fixed the problem.

                    | I wanted to address the root cause of the underlying problem: the people previously responsible for the
                    | site weighed it down with plugins and widgets. Collaborating with the executive team, we decided that the 
                    | new site would have minimal features. No calendars, no image carousels, no blogs. We identified a number of
                    | use cases and derived our features from there.

                    | I think the most common resource is funding. SGA gives a lot of money to on campus orgs
                    | and the process can be pretty confusing. We wanted to clearly lay out the process and types
                    | of funding we have.

                    | as well as how to receive funding from SGA, we needed to make all of
                    | those resources easily accessible. We built the Legislation page and a
                    | way admins can upload new versions of legislation from a custom CMS.
