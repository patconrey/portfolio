                | an iOS contractor at Bayer Crop Sciences. It all started with my first iOS app, Scene. The image

                    | This app was a lot of fun to program and design. Users can create an account with their 
                    | email, password and some other information, e.g., profile picture, birthday, etc. They can 
                    | search for others and start conversations, lock certain conversations with a passcode they 
                    | choose, send and save images and videos, view them later in custom media players, and update 
                    | their password and email.

                    | It all started with a personal challenge: how fast can I develop a robust chat application? 
                    | Firebase was a huge help, and OneSignal beautifully handled push notifications. The design 
                    | was largely inspired by purple, my favorite color, and Google's Material standard. This was 
                    | the next big project I worked on after my first app, Scene. I wanted to focus on the user. 
                    | At the time, that meant pretty animations and a good color scheme. With research, I came to 
                    | learn about accessibility and developing for all users regardless of their culture, capabilities, 
                    | or background. I learned a ton and refine those lessons every day.

                    | calls to utilize a mesh network for localized communication. This would be useful if, for example, 
                    | you're on a trip with your friends and don't want to use up data.

                    | build whatever structure you can imagine right in your living room. You can save structures,
                    | which triggers the app to construct a custom XML file describing your structure, saving it 
                    | locally and uploading it to a sever. Ultimately, I want to be able to share structures 
                    | between users, create fun textures with special properties, and collaboratively build in

                    | Scene was a social app that let users in a given city log on and see what was happening around them. 
                    | They could like and comment on scenes (the name we assigned to event listings). We provided 
                    | authentication through email, Facebook, and anonymous users. The entire app was built on Firebase 
                    | and we handled push notifications with OneSignal. Scene was my first dive into programming beyond 
                    | the python and C++ encountered in the standard Electrical Engineering curriculum. I learned Swift 
                    | through countless hours of Youtube videos, reading Apple's documentation, and Stack Overflow. 
                    | It was an ... experience ... to say the least.

                    | My friend came up with the idea in our sophomore year of college. I designed all of the 
                    | interfaces over the next few months and we began scouting for a mobile developer. None of 
                    | them worked out, so I decided to program it myself. Before I started learning the language, 
                    | I sent screenshots of the UI to my friend in Silicon Valley -- the only developer I knew. 
                    | His advice was simple: "That's ambitious. But doable, definitely doable!" Enduring innumerable 
                    | crashes, failed features, bad designs, tons of revisions, and full course loads for two 
                    | degrees, I launched Scene on the App Store in April 2017.
                    | <br>
                    | What started with a simple idea launched me on a pretty awesome journey. Through it, I learned 
                    | the basics of iOS development, team management, project planning, and even talked to angel 
                    | investors. Since April 2017, I've developed and designed all of the projects you see on this site.

                    | liked CDs and was rarely in her car. I got the idea for a music player interface that prominently 
                    | displays a spinning CD of the album art for the current song.
                    | <br><br>
                    | This app isn't connected to the internet or a streaming service. It would just come with a 
                    | preloaded playlist of songs. The code isn't hosted on my GitHub, but if you're interested please 
                    | feel free to reach out!
